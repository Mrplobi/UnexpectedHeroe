Platformer for JIN project

The project was made in a span of 2 weeks and a half as a first game and a way to discover c++ in more details.
The "game "in itself is a simplistic platformer, to be honest, calling it a game hurts me since it's so far from finished.

It uses three external libraries : SFML (drawing), Pugixml (datahandling) and box2d (physics).

I have not had the time to properly implement colisions, thus mutiple times is impossible (can't check if I'm on the ground so....)

I wish I could have done better, but since I designed it's basis to be wider, I might pick it up later with unity or something.
